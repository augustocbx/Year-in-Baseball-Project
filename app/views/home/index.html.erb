				<h2>1908</h2>
				<div>The 1908 Major League Baseball Season has been considered by some to be one of the most exciting seasons of all time. By the completion of the season, the top three teams in each league were within one game of each other at a time when only two teams total could qualify for the post-season. The Chicago Cubs and New York Giants finished the season tied for first in the National League, thanks to the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle's_Boner">Merkle's Boner</a> and were forced to play a one-game playoff to qualify for the World Series. The Cubs went on to win the game and the World Series over the Detroit Tigers, the last time they won the championship. </div>
